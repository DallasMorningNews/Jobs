## Computational Journalist

*The Dallas Morning News* is looking for a computational journalist to join its newsroom.

The right candidate has a complementary mix of code skills and journalism chops. She or he will help lead a new emphasis on developing our interactive and graphic storytelling online while continuing *The News’* tradition of statistically sophisticated and data-dense journalism.

Bring home a hot take on statewide demographic trends, grind out an election app or drop readers deep into a non-linear narrative. Your job is to bring the news to readers online with all the richness of the medium.

The position will be part of *The News’* Projects team, but whoever fills it will range across beats to support data-driven journalism all over the newsroom. She or he will also develop web apps, data visualizations and open source tools to support her own and other staff reporting.

The right candidate has sound news judgment, is a facile writer of code (and sometimes copy), works easily between teams of developers and journalists and coolly manages deadlines.

 
Applicants should have:

- At least 1 year experience producing web applications using a modern development framework. (Django is our tipple. What's yours?)
- Significant experience (preferably in a newsroom) turning careful, data-driven analyses into compelling graphics and dataviz using a web-native visualization library like D3.js.
- A complete suite of data cleaning and analysis techniques, including advanced SQL and data munging in a modern programming language. Python is preferred.
- Sound understanding of basic statistical principles. Competence with statistical software like R earns bonus points.
- Experience producing clean code and collaborating on development projects. Made open-source software before? Awesome. Tell us about it.
- Bachelor’s degree or equivalent work experience.


**To apply**, send a resume, links to significant work and your Github handle to dmnjobs@dallasnews.com.
