## Computational Journalist

*The Dallas Morning News* is looking for a computational journalist to join its newsroom.

The right candidate has a complementary mix of code skills and journalism chops. She or he will help lead a new emphasis on developing our interactive, graphic and otherwise visual storytelling online while continuing *The News’* tradition of statistically sophisticated and data-dense journalism.

The position will be part of *The News’* Data and News Applications team, but whoever fills it will range across beats to support data-driven graphic journalism all over the newsroom. She or he will build their own storytelling through online graphics, dataviz and maps; help develop newsroom dataviz tools and craft interactives and newsapps with backend developers, designers and beat reporters.

*The News* is currently undergoing a reorganization under new management with a reorientation toward digital production and audience growth. The team this candidate will join will be at its largest in *The News’* history, supported by other digital producers and interactive developers in the newsroom.

The right candidate has sound news judgment, is a facile writer of code (and sometimes copy), works easily across departments within the newsroom and coolly manages deadlines.


Applicants should:

- Have at least one year of experience turning careful, data-driven analyses into compelling graphics and dataviz using a web-native visualization library like D3.js.
- Be proficient with front-end technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Experience with a front-end JavaScript framework like Backbone or Angular is a plus.
- Have experience cleaning complex datasets for analysis and visualization, hopefully within a web-standard database like PostgreSQL.
- Have sound understanding of basic statistical principles. Competence with statistical software like R and dataviz packages like ggplot2 earns bonus points.
- Have experience producing clean code and collaborating on development projects. Made open-source software before? Awesome. Tell us about it.
- Have a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent work experience.

**To apply**, send a resume, links to significant work and your Github handle to dmnjobs@dallasnews.com.
