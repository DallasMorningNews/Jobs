## Newsroom web developer

#### Basic Function

The newsroom web developer will work closely with 300 journalists from within the newsroom. She or he will be responsible for experimenting with new forms of content to engage our readers; developing immersive storytelling applications; and creating tools that help journalists produce interactive graphics and other rich media.

The developer should be comfortable working in a sandbox environment: conceive, develop, deliver, test, evaluate and iterate across new products that enliven readers’ experience with The News in their medium of choice.

Find a way to turn memes into the next modality of journalism or build a useful civic tool to fight corruption and waste. All lanes are open to candidates who can realize great apps and kill their darlings.

The right candidate will excel at cultivating ideas alongside journalists and easily share code with other developers, data specialists and web producers across the newsroom.

#### Responsibilities/Duties:

Conceive, develop, test and successfully deploy web applications.
Effectively manage multiple project development cycles from conception to execution and consistently meet deadlines.
Write clean code with an emphasis on documentation and open source standards.
Refactor code according to frequently changing requirements and respond promptly to errors and bug reports.
Coordinate with journalists, other developers and web producers in the newsroom.
Quote accurate estimates of delivery dates.
Create metrics reports and other feedback loops to measure project impact.
Adhere to (or improve!) corporate usability, design and branding standards.
