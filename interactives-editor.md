## Interactives Editor

*The Dallas Morning News* is looking for an interactives editor to join its newsroom. The right candidate has a complementary mix of coding, design, and data skills along with journalism chops. She or he will help in our emphasis on developing our interactive, graphic and otherwise visual storytelling online while continuing *The Newsâ€™* tradition of statistically sophisticated and data-dense accountability journalism.

The position will be part of *The News'* Data and Interactives team, but whoever fills it will range across beats to support data-driven and visual journalism all over the newsroom. In addition, she or he will generate their own original storytelling through interactive digital story presentations, graphics, dataviz and maps. She or he will also help develop newsroom tools and collaborate with reporters, editors and photographers to craft interactives.
The right candidate has sound news judgment, is an adept writer of code (and sometimes copy), works easily across departments within the newsroom and coolly manages deadlines.


#### Applicants should:

- Have at least two years experience developing interactive story presentations or news applications and turning careful, data-driven analyses into compelling graphics and dataviz using a web-native visualization library like D3.js.
- Be proficient with front-end technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Experience with a front-end JavaScript framework is a plus.
- Be proficient in a scripting language (Python's our choice) enough so that you could write a simple Web scraper or use it to clean an unruly data set. Experience with a server-side Web framework like Django is a plus.
- Have experience using data to produce informative, interactive maps using mapping tools such as Mapbox GL JS or QGIS.
- Have sound understanding of basic statistical principles. Competence with statistical software like R and dataviz packages like ggplot2 is a plus.
- Have experience producing clean code with clear documentation and collaborating on development projects. Made open-source software before? Awesome. Tell us about it.
- Have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent work experience.
