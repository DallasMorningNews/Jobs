# Data and News Applications Editor

*The Dallas Morning News* is looking for an editor to lead its data and news applications team.

The right candidate has a complementary mix of code skills and journalism chops. She or he will help lead a new emphasis on developing our interactive, graphic and visual storytelling online while continuing *The News’* tradition of statistically sophisticated and data-dense journalism.

The position will lead a team of three other data/developer journalists, but whoever fills it will range across beats to support and lead data-driven journalism all over the newsroom. This position reports directly to the managing editor.

This is a player-coach role, so being able to support the team’s work while also being a productive member is critical. The position will be a good fit for someone who has honed her/his skills as developer or data journalist in the newsroom and has developed a strong vision for the expansive role these journalists can play in a newsroom.

The right candidate has sound news judgment, is a facile writer of code and copy, works easily across departments within the newsroom and coolly manages deadlines.

*The News* is a strong regional paper embracing a [digital-first direction](https://www.poynter.org/2016/at-the-dallas-morning-news-becoming-truly-digital-means-starting-over/400041/) and emphasizing engagement with its readers over clicks.


Our preferred applicant:

- Has worked as a newsroom data journalist/developer for 3 years or more.
- Has some management experience and a strong sense of vision for this work.
- Is well versed in open records laws and has successfully negotiated complex data requests before.
- Has solid data analysis skills including statistical applications.
- Is competent in at least one modern programming language and one modern server-side web development framework. (Python/Django is _The News’_ preferred combo.)
- Is a competent front-end developer with a good sense of design.
- Has a Bachelor’s degree or equivalent work experience.
- Is eager to make up for any of these preferred qualities she/he may lack.
