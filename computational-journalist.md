## Computational Journalist

**The Dallas Morning News* is looking for a computational journalist to join its newsroom.

The right candidate has a complementary mix of code skills and journalism chops. She or he will help in our emphasis on developing our interactive, graphic and otherwise visual storytelling online while continuing **The News'** tradition of statistically sophisticated and data-dense accountability journalism.

The position will be part of **The News'** Data and Interactives team, but whoever fills it will range across beats to support data-driven and visual journalism all over the newsroom. She or he will build their own storytelling through online graphics, dataviz and maps; help develop newsroom tools and collaborate with reporters, editors and photographers to craft interactives.

The right candidate has sound news judgment, is a facile writer of code (and sometimes copy), works easily across departments within the newsroom and coolly manages deadlines.

#### Applicants should:

- Have at least one year of experience turning careful, data-driven analyses into compelling graphics and dataviz using a web-native visualization library like D3.js.
- Be proficient with front-end technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Experience with a front-end JavaScript framework is a plus.
- Be proficient in a scripting language (Python's our choice) enough so that you could write a simple Web scraper or use it to clean an unruly data set. Experience with a server-side Web framework like Django is a plus.
- Have experience cleaning complex datasets for analysis and visualization, hopefully within a web-standard database like PostgreSQL.
- Have sound understanding of basic statistical principles. Competence with statistical software like R and dataviz packages like ggplot2 earns bonus points.
- Have experience producing clean code with clear documentation and collaborating on development projects. Made open-source software before? Awesome. Tell us about it.
- Have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent work experience.
