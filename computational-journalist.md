## Computational Journalist

*The Dallas Morning News* is looking for a computational journalist to join its newsroom as a member of the data and interactive design team. In this role, you will have the opportunity to work on a mix of high impact journalism and quick-turn daily stories through data reporting, analysis and visual journalism.

As part of *The News'* data and interactive design team, you will fill one of the most collaborative positions in the newsroom. You'll partner with reporters, editors and visual journalists across the newsroom to help report and publish ambitious stories and projects through data reporting and analysis and visual journalism. You'll also have the opportunity to pitch, report and develop your own data and interactive story ideas.

### About the team
The *The News'* data and interactive design team is comprised of computational journalists, interactive designers and graphics artists, but at our core, we are all journalists. We have a wide range of skills, including data analysis and visualization and reporting, front- and back-end development and visual design. We work on a wide range of projects, including [elections]("https://www.dallasnews.com/interactives/2018/shifting-tide-of-texas-politics") and [state government]("https://www.dallasnews.com/interactives/2018/redistricting-redux"), [investigative]("https://www.dallasnews.com/interactives/2018/pain-and-profit/index.html) and [enterprise]("https://www.dallasnews.com/interactives/2019/north-texas-senior-living-serial-killer-billy-chemirmir/") reporting and [visual]("https://www.dallasnews.com/interactives/2019/the-time-we-have-here-photos-of-thomas-jefferson-hs-immigrant-soccer-players")  storytelling.
  
### About you

- While you may have a skill set that goes beyond traditional reporting — whether that includes working with data, code, or both — you still consider yourself a journalist and have at least a year of experience working with data and/or digital design within a newsroom setting.
- You're collaborative, adept at working with writers, editors and photographers to execute large projects. You also want to have a voice in story direction, especially in areas that pertain to data reporting and/or visual execution.
- You're capable of pitching and reporting your own stories. While we work with other departments in the newsroom, we are not a service desk and take pride in producing our own work.
- You have experience writing front-end code to support and present your work to readers across a range of screen sizes and devices, whether that be in digestible data visualizations or more full-fledged story presentations.
